    "\n",
    "In this section, we will delve into the mathematical foundations of bias and variance, providing formal definitions that will help frame our understanding of these concepts in the context of model evaluation and performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A. Generalization Error\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's define the **generalization error** of a model, which is crucial in understanding bias and variance. The generalization error is the difference between the true labels \\( y \\) and the predicted labels \\( \\hat{y} \\) for a given input \\( x \\). It can be expressed mathematically as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "E = \\mathbb{E}[(y - \\hat{y})^2]\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $ \\mathbb{E} $ denotes the expected value over all possible training sets or data distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Bias\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bias** quantifies how far the average model prediction is from the true function that we are trying to learn. Mathematically, bias can be defined as the difference between the expected prediction of our model and the true output (target value). The bias can be expressed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "\\text{Bias}(\\hat{y}) = \\mathbb{E}[\\hat{y}] - y\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "- Here, \\( \\mathbb{E}[\\hat{y}] \\) represents the expected (average) prediction of the model over different datasets.\n",
    "- High bias indicates that the model’s predictions are consistently off from the actual target, leading to systematic errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### C. Variance\n",
    "\n",
    "**Variance** (\\( \\text{Var} \\)) measures how much the predictions of the model change when we use different training data. It indicates the model's sensitivity to the specific training set. Variance can be mathematically defined as:\n",

    "     - $ \\sigma^2 $: Represents the noise in the data that cannot be reduced by the model.\n",

    "The relationship between bias, variance, and the total error is often visualized in a graph:\n",
    "\n",
    "- On the x-axis, we can plot model complexity, ranging from simple models (high bias) to complex models (high variance).\n",
    "- On the y-axis, we plot the error.\n",

    "   - When evaluating different models, understanding their inherent bias and variance is essential. \n",
    "   - Simple models might be suitable for smaller datasets, while complex models may serve larger, more intricate datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Regularization**:\n",
    "   - Techniques such as L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) regularization are effective strategies to control variance without excessively increasing bias. Regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function, discouraging excessively complex models.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Cross-Validation**:\n",
    "   - Using k-fold cross-validation allows you to assess model performance more robustly and helps reveal tendencies towards overfitting or underfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Ensemble Methods**:\n",
    "   - Techniques like bagging and boosting can effectively reduce variance (in the case of bagging) or bias (in boosting) by combining the predictions of multiple models. Random Forest is an example of a bagging technique that reduces overfitting while maintaining good predictive performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Early Stopping**:\n",
