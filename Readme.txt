Machine Learning Research Repository

Welcome to our collaborative repository for researching and logging Machine Learning concepts! This space is dedicated to helping us understand and document the various topics and challenges we encounter while learning Machine Learning.
Purpose

The goal of this repository is to:

    Document our research and learning progress.
    Create a reference for commonly encountered problems and their solutions.
    Save time by sharing knowledge and avoiding duplicate efforts.

Contribution Guidelines

    Creating Jupyter Notebooks:
        When you encounter a concept or problem you donâ€™t understand, create a Jupyter Notebook to document your research and solutions.
        Follow the suggested notebook structure (see below).

    Logging Learning Progress:
        Use Jupyter Notebooks to log your learning progress for any concept.
        Ensure your notes are clear and well-documented.

    Updating Notebooks:
        If you find something unclear in an existing notebook, research the topic and update the notebook with your findings.
        Make updates in a branch and submit a pull request for review.
