    "That sounds like an exciting challenge! We'll break the project down into manageable steps so it’s easier to follow and understand. Since we are aiming for complexity, we might delve into topics such as deep learning, model optimization, and deployment. However, we’ll start by clarifying the foundation and then gradually move toward more intricate concepts and tasks.\n",
