This Repository has Python - Jupyter Notebooks recording all the mathematical concepts that I did not understand and thus studied.
The Notebooks in this repository should have the following features:
- Easy to Understand Knowledge of concepts
- Examples detailing concepts.
- Explain the pre-requisite - knowledge when necessary
- Your Thought Process when you encounter a problem and solution to that problem.
- Explain with pictures and graphs when necessary.
